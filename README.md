# Pulse Hunt (client/frontend)

Pulse Hunt is a market place where Indie Trainers can offer their workout sessions to users.

This is client/front-end. The back-end/server can be found [here](https://github.com/Tezenn/pulsehunt-backend).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* NPM
* The server running in background.

You can run the front-end alone, but none of the functionality will work.
